# Roadmap: Epoch-Driven Execution

MachPay progresses through milestone checkpoints, not calendar dates. Each epoch unlocks a new network effect described in the whitepaper.\[file:///Users/abhishektomar/Desktop/git/machpay-docs/whitepaper/machpay_whitepaper.pdf]

## Epoch 1 — Foundation

- **Environment**: Base Sepolia Testnet
- **Infra**: Centralized Gateway relayer operated by the core team
- **Goals**:
  - Deploy MachPayCore + BondManager (audited)
  - Ship Python + Node agent SDKs
  - Onboard first 5–10 vendors for weather/data/compute
- **Exit Criteria**: 10k testnet transactions + 20 active agent builders

## Epoch 2 — Decentralization

- **Environment**: Base Mainnet + \$MACH Token Generation Event
- **Infra**: Permissioned relayer set with staking requirements
- **Goals**:
  - Launch public token + bond staking
  - Enable vendor payouts on mainnet
  - Whitelist community relayers (Infura/Alchemy analogs)
- **Exit Criteria**: \$5M equivalent settled + relayer set handles >50% of volume

## Epoch 3 — Scale

- **Environment**: Multi-chain settlement (Base, Arbitrum, Solana bridge)
- **Infra**: Open relayer registry + DAO governance
- **Goals**:
  - Permissionless relayers with dynamic fee market
  - Cross-chain intent routing and settlement
  - DAO votes on protocol fees, treasury, and grants
- **Exit Criteria**: DAO-controlled treasury + cross-chain volume exceeds single-chain volume

Progression through epochs only occurs when the previous set of metrics is satisfied, ensuring responsible decentralization.\[file:///Users/abhishektomar/Desktop/git/machpay-docs/whitepaper/machpay_whitepaper.pdf]
